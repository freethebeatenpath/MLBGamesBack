Provided in the JSON was:

```
"division" : {
      "id" : 200,
      "link" : "/api/v1/divisions/200"
    },
```

and 

```
"divisionRecords" : [ {
          "wins" : 47,
          "losses" : 18,
          "pct" : ".723",
          "division" : {
            "id" : 200,
            "name" : "American League West",
            "link" : "/api/v1/divisions/200"
          }
        }, {
          "wins" : 19,
          "losses" : 13,
          "pct" : ".594",
          "division" : {
            "id" : 201,
            "name" : "American League East",
            "link" : "/api/v1/divisions/201"
          }
        }, {
          "wins" : 18,
          "losses" : 13,
          "pct" : ".581",
          "division" : {
            "id" : 202,
            "name" : "American League Central",
            "link" : "/api/v1/divisions/202"
          }
        } ],
```

I could assume that because the `divisionRecords` showing the American League (West/East/Central) and more games in the American League (from the `leagueRecords`); That the Houston Astros are in the American League. Furthermore, we can look at the number of games between the American League (West/East/Central) and we can conclude that the Houston Astros are in the American League West. I was unable to conclude that was 100% accurate form the provided JSON, I took another approach.


I could run separate API calls to get the appropriate data to fill in the blanks.

I instead hard coded a little the division id with the division name.

Created a `MLBObject` (to contain the values from the request) that could be expanded on later. Used Parcelable over Serial because it is faster.

I have never used OKHTTP, but I used it because I think thatâ€™s what used at MLB. Easy Simple to use. Just need to make sure its thread safe.

Tested on emulator and physical Samsung device.

I will probably work on this some more later tonight. Currently provided is a working example and within the Acceptance Criteria.

Thanks
